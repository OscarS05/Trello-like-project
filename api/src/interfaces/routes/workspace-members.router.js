 *       - If the user being removed is the only member of a project or team, deletion will be blocked to avoid orphaned entities.
 *       - If possible, ownership of any project, team, or the workspace itself is automatically transferred to another existing member before deletion.
 *
 *       This ensures data integrity and avoids orphaned entities within the system.
